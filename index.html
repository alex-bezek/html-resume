					<h2>Associate Lead Software Engineer</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Sept 2019 - Present</p>
					<p>Currently I work as a technical lead for key projects, and an individual contributor on strategic projects. I often tackle initiatives for deployment changes and new operational requirements first, creating dev tooling, documentation, and a repeatable process for other teams to consume.</p>

					<h2>
						Team Lead | Senior Software Engineer</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Mar 2017 - Sept 2019</p>
					<p>I was as a team lead with direct reports and a Product Owner for a React on Rails based application. I met with vendors, clients, and other stake holders to gather requirements for the team to implement. I volunteered for this to learn React as we didn't have any senior React Engineers.</p>

						<h2>Software Engineer - Associate Software Engineer</h2>
						<p class="subDetails">Jun 2014 â€“ Mar 2017</p>

During this time Docker and the Container Wars were blossoming and I spent my free time exploring these systems. I joined a second team on the side to be involved with the initial Docker Automated deployments project and CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Spinnaker.</p>

					<p>To learn more about Nrgok, I decided to use this as an excuse to play with it. I setup
						<a href="https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok/blob/master/docs/SELFHOSTING.md">Ngrok V1</a>
						on an EC2 instance behind an ALB using a Certificate and Domain I own. My Rasberry-Pi is running the Ngrok client connecting to it and serving this file. If you have the v1 Ngrok client, you can connect with the following config.yml file
						<pre>
							<code>
server_addr: alexbezek.me:4443
trust_host_root_certs: true
							</code>
